Lecture 1 (Sam Altman)
* Idea -> Product -> Team -> Execution
* Startup success = Idea*Product*Team*Execution*Luck    0 <= Luck <= 10000
Idea
* Execution at least 10 times as important as Idea
* But Idea is still important. All great startups started with a great idea. Startups that became successful after pivoting are exceptions, not the norm.
* Idea: How excited you are about it, Size & growth of market, Strategy of the company, Defensibility of the business
* Startup must feel like a mission. Good startups take a decade to create.
* Good Startup = Good Idea that sounds like a bad one
* Idea need not sound big and important at the beginning but should focus on and completely capture a small segment of the market, with a potential to capture the entire market in future.
* Small and rapidly growing market customers are desperate for solutions and they will put up with an imperfect but rapidly improving product.
* You can not create a market that doesnt want to exist. You have to modify your startup accordingly.
* Why now? Why not earlier, why not later?
* If it takes more than a sentence to explain your idea, its usually too complicated to work.
* Begin with the demand and create the appropriate supply. 
Product
* Easier to build something that small no. of users LOVE rather than something that a large no. of users LIKE. LOVE: Growth from word of mouth.
* Tighten product feedback loops.
* Focus on metrics that matter. Be honest about growth.
Why startup?
BAD
* Extreme stress: Always on call and always working. Shit tends to hit the fan very easily.
* Responsibility: Your team has bet some of the best years of their life on you.
* Fundraising and unwanted media attention.
* Can not leave as a founder without having repurcussions on you and your team.
* Committed 10 years if its going well,  years if not (3 years to realize its not going well and 2 years at the aquihired company, awful)
Best Reason:
* You can't not do it
  - Passion: You need to do it
  - Aptitude: The world needs you to do it
