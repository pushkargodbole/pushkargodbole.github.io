Lecture 2 (Sam Altman)
* One of the hard parts of building a startup is that its real life.
Team
* Co-founders must know each other (for years)!
* Tough, calm and resourceful co-founder like James Bond.
* No. of co-founders: 2-3 > 1 > 4 > 5 ...
* Try not to hire: Hire only when you have a desperate need.
* All team members must have desperate dedication!
* Preferably get people you/your team already knows.
* Get someone who you would be comfortable interacting with socially and wouldn't mind swapping roles with.
* 10 of the company to first 10 employees.
* Give Autonomy, Expect Mastery, Create Purpose.
* You'll know when to fire someone. Dont hesitate to fire such people.
* Co-founder equity split: Dont delay, do within the first few weeks, split nearly equally.
Execution
* Whatever the founders do becomes the company culture.
* Focus: Find 2-3 most important things and just do those. Daily, weekly, monthly and so on.
* ALWAYS keep growth and momentum.
* Work together physically.
* There are a lot of great things about startups but work-life balance is not one of them.
* Be agile but dont trade-off quality. Be biased towards action.
* Sales fix everything.
* The competitor to be feared is the one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making their own business better.
* Press-releases are easier to write than code and still easier than making a great product.
