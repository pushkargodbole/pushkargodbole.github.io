Lecture 3 (Paul Graham)
* Startups are counterintuitive like skiing. Thats why you see ski instructors but you dont see running instructions. Because skiing is counterintuitive. Partners and VCs are your ski instructors in startups.
* But finding the right people is completely intuitive. Pick people for your startup just like you pick friends. Pick people that you genuinely like and respect and that you've known for long.
* Most young founders go through the motions of a startup with fund raising, hiring, renting and forget the most important part: Making something people want and love.
* When it comes to starting startups, a lot of people think they must do it while in college. You must not, can not start a startup as a student, because when you do, startups consume your entire life. Do not start a startup in college!
* Starting a startup is part of a larger plan of having a good life and if you start a startup at 20, you'll never get to bum around in life ever again. Mark Zuckerberg can not take a leisure trip backpacking around Thiland. Facebook is running him as much as he's running facebook.
* If you make a conscious effort of coming up with startup ideas, you'll think of ideas that are not only bad but also plausible sounding, meaning you and everybody else will have wasted a lot of time and energy before you realized they are no good.
* The very best ideas almost always start as side projects because they dont sound plausible enough to be thought of as startup ideas.
* Do - Learn a lot about things that matter, work on problems that interest you, with people you enjoy working with.
* Domain expertise matters!
