Customers have to get their perceptions from somewhere, its not through vaccuum. 20 years ago, if I wanted to know anything about a car, I would only know exactly what the brand told me about the car. Today I base my perceptions on what my friends tell me, what the bloggers tell me, what social media tells me; the car guy might have a clean beautiful message for the customers, but that would just form 2% of my perception.
When an advertiser decides to start a company, the first thing he does is think about the name and the logo, what the company should do comes next.
When we make products, for features we always focus on the power-user, but to design the UI, we think of the casual user. Take a BMW (or Tesla :P) for example, under the hood is all complexity, but driving it is pure simplicity, and that I think is the key insight behind most products that actually work.
When people are the media, they are not the kind of media that can be purchased. Well some people are, we call them Influencers, but most people can not be purchased. Therefore you have to be truly talk-worthy to be talked about by people.
